## README


Three jupyter notebooks can be found:

- tdp_gas_meters.ipynb 


    Solves the first request, calculates the total cost per meter and the total consumption per meter
    It uses the data from the gorilla.test_data.csv and rate_table for the forecast values.


- generate_consumption.data.ipynb


    This one runs the functions that generate a list of random meters of any size and mock consumption data using the generated random meters.


- benchmark.ipynb


    This functions benchmarks the all the previous functions and times the creation of random 

The functions can also be run separately, each contains basic parameters to run.

    - td_gas_meters.py (request #1)
    - random_meters.py (request #2)
    - mock_consumption.py (request #3)
    - transportation_cost.py (request #4)
    - benchmark.py (request #4)

Each line of code is properly commented.
